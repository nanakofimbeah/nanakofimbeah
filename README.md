  <h2 align="center">👋 Hello there, colleague engineer. My name is Nana Kofi Mbeah.</h2>
  <p align="center"> I was previously involved in the software engineering side of computer science, but I decided to pursue a career as a DevOps Engineer instead.</p>

On a personal note, I am a die-hard Manchester United FC fan. In my spare time, I enjoy watching Sci-Fi, crime, and action movies, as well as watching tech-related videos on <img src="assets/youtube.png" width= "13"> YouTube. I'm also a very fine writer who can write good thesis, forewords, novels, biographies, tributes, and so on.

📫 I can be reached via email at nanakofimbeah@gmail.com from anywhere in the world.

- 🔭 I have a lot of uncommitted Terraform repos on my local machine. Nowadays, the emphasis in computer science is on deployment rather than development.
- 🤝 Collaborations are welcome in Amazon Web Services, Terraform, Linux, Docker, Jenkins, and Ansible.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy sharing what I know and learning from other engineers.
